            <p class="text-center pt-3">JJ's Flowers is a florist based in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. We provide flowers for delivery and collection from our shop, just off Chatsworth Road. We also provide beautiful bespoke arrangements for weddings, funerals, floral styling and contracts.</p>
            <p class="text-center">We are a family-run business and have a small, friendly team who can help you with whatever you need - and don't forget Oscar the dog!</p>

                    <p>Back in 2013 a fearless 22 year old had a vision of this floral space that she knew she just had to create. The vision never actually changed from the beginning of the journey, we just kept adding to it and I think we will continue to do so.</p>
                    <p>Nearly 10 years later, JJ’s Flowers isn’t just that young girl that it once was (not just because she’s 10 years older!) but its now a team of incredible people.</p>

                    <p>Janet started helping Jessica when the shop got busier and her talent came out rather quickly.</p>
                    <p>Janet likes to tell people she is the other J in JJ’s but the truth is we are all JJ’s at heart.</p>
                    <p>Janet is Jessica’s Mum and you can always rely on a cracking lunch when she’s on shift.</p>

                    <p>There isn’t much Garry doesn’t do, he is the mind behind getting the flowers to hang from any area in an installation. The brains behind the pretty florals.</p>
                    <p>He’s fitted three shops out and continues to makes all the many changes to the shop still now.</p>
                    <p>He is our biggest fan, Garry is Jessica’s Dad and as soon as he walks in expects a cuppa in his hand.</p>

                    <p>Carla joined the team back in 2021.</p>
                    <p>Her interview was one we’ll never forget, admitting to making up her whole CV and getting on the floor with our shop dog Benjamin, but we knew she was going to fit right in with this crazy lot, and gosh how right were we.</p>
                    <p>She likes to tell everyone she’s the boss, so if you have a complaint ask for Carla.</p>

                    <p>The newest member of the team, Lindsey joined us this year.</p>
                    <p>Lindz slotted straight into the JJ’s team, friendly and outgoing, always with a smile on her face.</p>
                    <p>Lindz will be the first one to get the kettle on.</p>

                    <p>Oscar joined us in January 2022.</p>
                    <p>He came in to the shop with big boots to fill as we lost our beagle Benjamin. Pleased to say he is very much stepping up.</p>
                    <p>If you just want to call in and see Oscar by all means please do he loves belly rubs.</p>
